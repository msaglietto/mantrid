## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
go install github.com/msaglietto/mantrid@latest
```

## üèÅ Quick Start

### Basic Alias Management

1. Add a new alias:
   ```bash
   mantrid alias add hello "echo Hello, World!"
   ```

2. Execute an alias:
   ```bash
   mantrid do hello
   ```

3. List all aliases:
   ```bash
   mantrid alias list
   ```

4. Edit an existing alias:
   ```bash
   mantrid alias edit hello "echo Hello, Universe!"
   ```

5. Remove an alias:
   ```bash
   mantrid alias remove hello
   ```

### Simple Aliases (Auto-Append)

For simple command aliases without placeholders, parameters are automatically appended:

```bash
# Create simple aliases
mantrid alias add ls "ls"
mantrid alias add dk "docker"
mantrid alias add k "kubectl"

# Parameters are automatically appended
mantrid do ls -- -la /tmp           # Executes: ls -la /tmp
mantrid do dk -- ps -a              # Executes: docker ps -a
mantrid do k -- get pods            # Executes: kubectl get pods
```

### Aliases with Parameter Substitution

For advanced control, use placeholders:

- **Positional parameters**: `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc.
- **All parameters**: `$@` or `$*`

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create alias with placeholders
mantrid alias add greet "echo Hello, $1!"
mantrid alias add deploy "kubectl apply -f $1 -n $2"

# Parameters are substituted
mantrid do greet World              # Executes: echo Hello, World!
mantrid do deploy app.yaml prod     # Executes: kubectl apply -f app.yaml -n prod

# Use all parameters with $@
mantrid alias add search "grep -r $@ ."
mantrid do search "TODO"            # Executes: grep -r TODO .
```

### Passing Flags to Aliases

When you need to pass flags (arguments starting with `-` or `--`) to your aliases, use the `--` separator to prevent Cobra from interpreting them as flags to the `do` command itself:

```bash
# Simple execution
mantrid do hello

# With parameters
mantrid do greet Alice

# Using -- separator (useful for flags)
mantrid do ls -- -la /tmp
mantrid do docker -- run --rm -it ubuntu bash
mantrid do grep -- -r "pattern" .

# The -- tells Mantrid to pass everything after it as parameters
```

The `--` separator is especially useful when your alias needs to receive flags that would otherwise conflict with Mantrid's own command-line parsing.

**Security Note:** Aliases execute commands directly in your system shell. Only create aliases for commands you trust. Parameter substitution does not perform shell escaping - use with caution.

### Cloud Synchronization

5. Set up cloud synchronization:
   ```bash
   mantrid cloud setup
   ```

6. Sync your data to the cloud:
   ```bash
   mantrid cloud sync
   ```
