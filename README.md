# Mantrid

Let me introduce Mantrid the closet gnome that will help you to perform your task.

The objective of it is to be able to create alias and save those alias on the internet so you can read form different computers.

This is a pet project to learn go so I apologize for the code.

The idea is to minimize the transport of the dotfiles. Installing the application and then configuring the database you can have access to all your saved commands.
